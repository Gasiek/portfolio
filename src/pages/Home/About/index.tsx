      <Description>
        I'm Kacper GÄ…sior, a Unity developer with a passion for VR/AR and gaming. I earned my
        Master's in Human-Centered AI from DTU in Denmark, and experiences in Poland and Spain have
        enriched my creative approach to interactive design. Over the years, I've built immersive VR
        games, led development teams, and worked on a variety of industry projects - from AI-driven
        WebGL experiences to real-world XR solutions. My professional journey includes roles as an
        XR R&D Engineer, Unity Game Developer, and React Web Developer, giving me a
        well-rounded perspective on both technical and creative challenges. I thrive in
        collaborative environments, enjoy tackling complex projects, and am dedicated to creating
        engaging experiences that truly make a difference.
